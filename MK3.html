    <h1>Yaris-MK3 (2011-2020)</h1>

    <p>The third generation Vitz was introduced in December 2010 featuring a sportier stance, a redesigned front and a roomier interior. The new model uses a single windshield wiper instead of a pair of wipers and has its meter cluster positioned back in front of the driver and behind the wheel compared to its previous models. In European countries, the Yaris was also offered in 6-speed manual transmission for the 1.33L engine, or a CVT transmission often marketed as "7-speed MultiDrive" or "MultiDrive S". The 7-speed refers to the possibility to select a predefined gear ratio among 7 available, emulating a 7-speed sequential gearbox, with steering wheel levers.</p>
