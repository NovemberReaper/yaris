    <h1>Toyota Yaris 1999-present</h1>

    <p>The Toyota Yaris (Japanese: トヨタ・ヤリス, Hepburn: Toyota Yarisu) is a supermini/subcompact car sold by Toyota since 1999, replacing the Starlet and Tercel.

        Up to 2019, Toyota had used the Yaris nameplate on export versions of various Japanese-market models, with some markets receiving the same vehicles under the Toyota Echo name through 2005. Starting in 2020, the Yaris nameplate began to be used in Japan, which replaced the Vitz nameplate.[1]
        
        The Yaris nameplate has also been applied to other vehicles. From 1999 to 2005, the nameplate had been used for the Yaris Verso mini MPV sold in Europe, where it was known in Japan as the FunCargo. Since 2020, the nameplate has also been used for the subcompact crossover SUV offering called Yaris Cross. In North America, most Yaris sedan models sold from 2015 to 2020 and Yaris hatchbacks sold from 2019 until 2020 were restyled versions of the Mazda2, produced and developed by Mazda.
        
        In 2020, Toyota introduced the GR Yaris, which is a three-door performance-oriented variant of the XP210 series Yaris using the Gazoo Racing branding. It is built as a homologation model for the FIA World Rally Championship.
        
        The name "Yaris" is derived from "Charis", the singular form of Charites, the Greek goddesses of charm and beauty.[2] As of March 2020, the Yaris has sold 8.71 million units worldwide.[3]
