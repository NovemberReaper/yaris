    <h1>Yaris-MK4 (2020-present)</h1>

    <p>The fourth-generation Yaris, available initially only as a hatchback, was unveiled simultaneously on 16 October 2019 in Japan and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Built on the GA-B platform, its development was led by chief engineer Yasunori Suezawa and chief hybrid engineer Takashi Uehara. It went on sale in Japan on 10 February 2020, while the petrol 4WD variant went on sale in April 2020.

        A performance-oriented version developed by Toyota Gazoo Racing, called the GR Yaris, was first unveiled at the 2020 Tokyo Auto Salon and production began in September 2020.
        
        The XP210 Yaris Hybrid-based Mazda2 Hybrid went on sale in Europe in 2022.
        
        The North American market did not receive the fourth-generation Yaris. Additionally, the nameplate (which had been used for a restyled Mazda2) was eliminated entirely in 2020.
        
        The sedan version was introduced in August 2022, debuting in Thailand as the Yaris Ativ to replace the previous XP150 model. Designated AC100, the model was developed by Daihatsu using the company's DNGA-B platform.</p>
