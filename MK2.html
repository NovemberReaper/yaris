    <h1>Yaris-MK2 (2005-2013)</h1>

    <p>Toyota redesigned the Vitz in early 2005, going on sale in Japan that February. The Yaris family (Vitz and including the Belta) was developed under the lead of chief engineer Kousuke Shibahara. While the previous generation Vitz hatchback and Platz sedan look and feel virtually alike, the redesigned XP90 Vitz and Belta are more subtly related in terms of appearance. The two cars share underpinnings, notably the frame and the drivetrain components, however the sheet metal and interior is different. While the Vitz was designed at Toyota's European ED2 design studios, the Belta was designed at their Japanese design studios.

        The Vitz platform was larger in all metrics, to create a larger interior space on par with vehicles in the segment above. It had a short overhangs and cab-forward design. The Vitz has nine airbags for some models.</p>
